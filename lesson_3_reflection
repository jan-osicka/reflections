When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I am working on project with multiple people or i want to backup my project on the website instead just have locally



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

What if there will be more people on project and they do changes that I dont want in my local PC...
