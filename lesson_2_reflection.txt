What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You create git repository and you need it for making git work with this folder and start commiting:)

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Different is that staging area holds files temporarly inside ad than commit it to repository. Its better because we dont need to commit all files but only just that we were working with it.

I can see files inside staging area by command git status... and than pust it with git commit -m "Commit message"
